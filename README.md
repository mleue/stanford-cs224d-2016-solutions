My solutions for Stanford's "Deep Learning for NLP" (cs224d v2016) assignments

Syllabus can be found [here](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/syllabus.html).

Note that the assignments are specific to the 2016 version of the course. The syllabus page might get updated in the future and point to the latest version of the course.

The lecture videos for [cs224d 2016](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmImxx8Char9Ig0ZHSyTqGsdhb9weEGam) can be found on youtube.
Unfortunately they are incomplete: only lectures 1-8, 10 and 11 are available. However, they can be complemented with the lecture videos for [cs224d 2015](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmImxx8Char8dxWB9LRqdpCTmewaml96q) to almost get the entire picture.
